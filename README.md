# Code Showcase

Welcome to my repository. <br/>
I'm a self-taught programming enthusiast with little less than a year of coding experience. <br/>
Unfortunately, currently I have only 2 - 4 hours a day to spend on learning. <br/>
My goal is to become full stack developer, polyglot with strong skills and knowledge of network programming and a bit of computer graphics. <br/>

Please see:<br/>
Code snippets for clear and short pieces of code.<br/>
Learning I contains Flask w/ MongoDB.<br/>
Learning contains my progress on learning Flask w/ Postgres and D3, JS, HTML5, CSS3.<br/>
No-Gui is a smaller project not using any GUI. <br/>
PyQt5 is the bigger project. <br/>
